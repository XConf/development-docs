But when it comes to crunching huge volumes of data, our rails application starts to slow down. Here we are not talking about joining a couple of rows from multiple tables, but about processing months of historical data and providing meaning full information.\nDatabases are good at processing data, but we sometimes make the mistake of just using it to as a file cabinet. The database is optimized to crunch GB's of data and return to us the results that we need.\nSo my talk would be about how to optimize your database so as to speed up your existing Ruby on Rails application.",

The benefits have been both direct and low-level in the case of Erlang (building on top of the Cowboy HTTP server), and indirect and high-level in the case of Ruby (drawing on Sinatra and Rails). All of these influenes have come together in the Phoenix Framework.\n\nAlthough Phoenix touts itself as a MVC framework, it is not strictly limited to the Model-View-Controller pattern. In fact, MVC is a simplistic shorthand that elides rather than clarifies Phoenix&#39;s full potential.\n\nThis talk will peel back Phoenix&#39;s many layers and deconstruct its underlying asumptions.

        "description": "When DevOps team was established in 2016, development teams in Rakuten Travel were working in silos. Development teams had had separate development processes (build-automation tool, release-automation tool, site-operation tool). Also the development environment which all teams used together had infrastructure restrictions and development processes which slowed down the development in the organization level.\n\nDevOps team talked with each development teams and found issues to solve. Then DevOps team standardised the development processes by delivering software in the topic of System/Application Data Centralisation, Multiple Development Environment, High Availability, Data Visualisation, Table Definition Management. Most of our software is written in Ruby. After 2 years of DevOps activity, all development teams follow the standardised development process. Also, operational processes such as release automation and site operation are now consolidated to 1 team. As a result the productivity of our organisation improved dramatically.\n\nIn the process of developing software, DevOps team faced many issues. As many members did not have a developer background, we did not write unit-test for our Rails application. So we learned how to write rspec testcases and also introduced guard to achive TDD. Then, as the number of our Rails application increased, many duplicated codes exist such as getting server related information from cross-company internal API. So we learned to package duplicated code into rubygems and store it in internal gem repositories. When we faced a performance issue in our program, we tried to solve it by using multi-threading function. However Ruby was unfit for it and we ended up using Java instead.\n\nAnother important part of this DevOps activity was to adapt the standardised software to each development team. Development teams had their own development processes which were already efficient for them. So when we tried to adapt the software, while most development teams were supportive, some were not. In the latter case, we had to do many of the heavy lifting such as making code changes to the product code and testing products on our own. The most difficult part was actually creating testcases and executing testcases which are normally responsible by other development teams. This is mentally tough but very challenging part of DevOps activity.",
