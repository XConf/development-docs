Artifacts while developing the app.

## GraphQL Schema

We use [Apollo Launchpad](https://launchpad.graphql.com) to design and discuss on our GraphQL schema. It also act as a specification and a mock server that helps us to work parallely on the backend and app.

The source file is [launchpad.js](./launchpad.js), and a pad on Apollo Launchpad exists [here](https://launchpad.graphql.com/p0n3w91zk0).
